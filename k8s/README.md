# ðŸš€ Kubernetes Learning Journey ðŸ“‚

Welcome to my **Kubernetes Learning Repository**! This folder showcases various Kubernetes YAML files that I have created while learning different aspects of Kubernetes. Each file represents a milestone in my learning journey, documenting my hands-on experience with Kubernetes components.

## ðŸ“‹ What's Inside?

This folder contains various YAML configuration files related to Kubernetes, such as:

- **Pod Configurations**: Files demonstrating how to create and manage Pods, including single and multi-container Pods.
- **Deployments**: YAML files showcasing how to create, update, and manage Deployments for scalable applications.
- **Services**: Configurations for exposing applications via ClusterIP, NodePort, and LoadBalancer services.
- **ConfigMaps & Secrets**: Examples showing how to manage application configuration and sensitive data securely.
- **Volume Management**: Files demonstrating the use of Persistent Volumes (PV) and Persistent Volume Claims (PVC) to manage storage.

## âœ¨ Highlights

- **Hands-On Learning**: Each file is created as part of my practical learning experience.
- **Step-by-Step Progress**: The files are arranged in a sequence that reflects my learning path in Kubernetes.
- **Ready to Use**: You can directly apply these YAML files to your Kubernetes cluster using `kubectl apply -f <filename>.yaml`.
